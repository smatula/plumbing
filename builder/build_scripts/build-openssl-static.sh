# A second, static-only OpenSSL for packages that embed OpenSSL directly in
# their extension module instead of linking it dynamically. cryptography is the
# case that matters: its official PyPI wheels are built this way, shipping one
# self-contained _rust.abi3.so with no libcrypto/libssl beside it.
#
# Dynamically linked against the shared build, auditwheel bundles libcrypto and
# libssl into the wheel but cannot see ossl-modules/legacy.so, because OpenSSL
# dlopens it and auditwheel only follows DT_NEEDED. The bundled libcrypto also
# carries a MODULESDIR compiled to this image's paths, which do not exist
# wherever the wheel is installed. OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, "legacy") then fails
# and Blowfish, CAST5, IDEA, SEED, ARC4 and RC2 become unusable.
#
# Configure notes:
#   no-module  builds the providers, "legacy" included, into libcrypto.a.
#              Without it they are only ever separate .so modules, which a
#              statically linked wheel has no way to reach. no-shared does NOT
#              imply this.
#   -fPIC      these archives get linked into a shared object.
#
# This prefix is deliberately named so it does NOT match the /opt/_internal/
# openssl* globs the final stage uses to publish the shared build into
# /usr/local/{include,lib,lib/pkgconfig} -- it must stay off PKG_CONFIG_PATH and
# out of ldconfig so nothing links it by accident. A package opts in explicitly
# by setting OPENSSL_DIR and OPENSSL_STATIC.
